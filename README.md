In this project, I worked on a supervised machine learning problem. The goal of the project is to predict housing prices in California based on different features related to houses and districts.
I used the California Housing dataset (california_housing_train.csv). This dataset contains numerical features such as median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, latitude, and longitude. The target variable in this dataset is median_house_value, which represents the median house price in each district.
Since the target variable is a continuous numerical value, this problem is considered a regression problem. The model is expected to learn the relationship between the input features and the median house value so it can predict housing prices for new unseen data.
